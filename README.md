## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Isaac, an MSCS student at Northwestern University. My main interest lies in cloud security and LLM agents. I find the combination of these two fields particularly appealing and enjoy exploring the cutting edge of this intersection.

I'm also a part-time CTF player and have a [CTF team](https://ctftime.org/team/154480). You are welcomed to play with us just for fun!

Checkout my personal blog [here](https://www.whale3ye.com/)! This has also been open-sourced in my repo [here](https://github.com/WHALEEYE/chaos).
